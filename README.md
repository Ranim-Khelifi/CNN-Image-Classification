# CNN-Image-Classification
📂 Datasets

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs.  
It also provides a simple **Tkinter interface** where you can upload an image and see the prediction result.


## Features
- Preprocessing of image data (reshape, normalization).  
- CNN model with:
  - Convolutional layers (feature extraction)  
  - MaxPooling layers (dimensionality reduction)  
  - Dense layers (classification)  
- Binary classification → **Cat 🐱 vs Dog 🐶**  
- Model training with Keras/TensorFlow.  
- Save and load model (`.h5` format).  
- Interactive **Tkinter GUI** to upload an image and get prediction with probability.  


## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep Learning  
- **NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization  
- **Tkinter** – GUI for user interaction
